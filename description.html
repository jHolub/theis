                The Theis (1935) solution (or Theis nonequilibrium method) is useful for determining the hydraulic properties 
                (transmissivity and storativity) of nonleaky confined aquifers. Analysis involves matching the Theis 
                type curve for nonleaky confined aquifers to nonequilibrium (i.e., transient) drawdown data collected 
                during a pumping test (aquifer test or aquifer performance test).

                Charles Vernon Theis was the first to develop a rigorous mathematical model of transient flow of water to 
                a pumping well by recognizing the physical analogy between heat flow in solids and groundwater flow in 
                porous media. 

                <h4>The Theis solution is based on the following assumptions:</h4>    

                <ul>
                    <li>The flow in the aquifer is adequately described by Darcy's law (i.e. Re&lt;10).</li>
                    <li>homogeneous, isotropic, confined aquifer,</li>
                    <li>well is fully penetrating (open to the entire thickness (<i>b</i>) of aquifer),</li>
                    <li>the well has zero radius (it is approximated as a vertical line) â€” therefore no water can be stored in the well,</li>
                    <li>the well has a constant pumping rate Q,</li>
                    <li>the head loss over the well screen is negligible,</li>
                    <li>aquifer is infinite in radial extent,</li>
                    <li>horizontal (not sloping), flat, impermeable (non-leaky) top and bottom boundaries of aquifer,</li>
                    <li>groundwater flow is horizontal</li>
                    <li>no other wells or long term changes in regional water levels (all changes in potentiometric surface are the result of the pumping well alone)</li>
                </ul>         
                The Theis type curve method, used for determining the hydraulic properties of aquifers, 
                is based on the following mathematical equation (i.e., the Theis equation) for flow to a fully penetrating 
                line sink discharging at a constant rate in a homogeneous, isotropic and nonleaky confined aquifer of infinite extent:

                <br><br>
                where W() is the well-khown well function, Q is the discharge (pumping) rate of the well, T and S are transmissivity and storativity of aquifer, r is the distance level between well and observation point and t is the time since pumping start.
